# CIT-114-Storage-Notes
Volatile memory is a type of storage whose contents are erased when the system's power is turned off or interrupted.
NV or Non-volatile memory is a term used to describe any memory or storage that is saved regardless of the power to the computer is on or off. 
In computing, there is many forms of storage. Temporary storage, such as RAM, allows a computer to temporarily store information while the computer is in use, however when power is removed, the information stored in temporary storage is lost.
As the computer boots, parts of the operating system and drivers are loaded into memory (RAM), which allows the CPU to process the instructions faster and speeds up the boot process. RAM is temporary storage that allows data and programs to be stored in memory in order the operating system to use them.
A hard drive can be used to store any data, including pictures, music, videos, text documents, and any files created or downloaded. 
Another common storage is optical storage, which uses lasers and lights as its method of reading and writing data
Unlike a standard hard drive, the flash drive has no movable parts; it contains only an integrated circuit memory chip that is used to store data. Flash drives usually have plastic or aluminum casings surrounding the memory chip.
